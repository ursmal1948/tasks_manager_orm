- User Collaboration: Facilitates collaboration through comments on tasks, allowing users to provide updates, feedback, and discussions related to specific tasks.

- History Tracking: Maintains a history of changes made to tasks, capturing details such as modifications, dates, and the users responsible for the changes.
